# IRIS_FLOWER_LOGISTIC_REGRESSION
Here we did an exploratory data analysis and model building on Iris dataset using Jupyter notebook.
The Iris dataset is a famous dataset in machine learning and statistics, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. Each sample is described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters. The goal of using logistic regression with the Iris dataset is typically to perform classification, where the model predicts the species of iris based on these four features. Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm that models the probability of an input belonging to a particular class. In the case of the Iris dataset, a multiclass variant of logistic regression can be used to classify the iris species by fitting a separate logistic regression model for each class, assigning the class with the highest probability as the predicted species for a given input.
